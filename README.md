Vanilla ASP.Net Membership SQL
=======================

These are the SQL dumps for the tables created when you run the ASP.Net membership application wizard.

These tables need to be created and initialized if you want to make an MVC Membership site. 

### Purpose

I created these for cases when you're in an environment blocked by a firewall or don't have the proper permissions to create these tables with the aspnet_regsql.exe tool.
Or you IT department has no clue on how to do anything so they just turn off everything. 

As with all SQL, careful where and how you run it.
